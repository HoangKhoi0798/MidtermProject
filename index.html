      <p>"Viet Nam is not short of reasons to be concerned about climate change. With 70 percent of the population living along the coast or in the country’s two major deltas, it is at risk from sea level rise, floods, drought, and other extreme weather events. Thousands have already been relocated from vulnerable regions, and increased saltwater intrusion, typhoons, flooding, and landslides could force hundreds of thousands more from homes and farms. The bitter reality of climate change is that the people and communities that will bear the heaviest burden did not cause the crisis." - <a href="https://www.undp.org/vietnam/viet-nam-climate-justice-means-tackling-disparities-globally-and-home">UNDP</a></p>
      <br>
      <p>"Although Vietnam is a modest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitter, GHG emissions have multiplied fivefold in the last 20 years—largely fueled by significant growth in the energy sector. The energy sector is responsible for more than half of the country’s GHG emissions, followed by agriculture, industrial processes, and waste." - <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/vietnam/fact-sheets/sector-climate-change">USAID</a></p>
