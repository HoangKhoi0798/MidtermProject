Sunlight and wind, for example, are such sources that are constantly being replenished. Renewable energy sources are plentiful and all around us. Generating renewable energy creates far lower emissions than burning fossil fuelsand generate three times more jobs than fossil fuels. <br>
                By utilizing and improving the technology to harvest these kinds of energy, we can:</p>

                        <li>Allow for a wider range of energy sources</li>

                Not everything happen on our planet can or should be intervened by human technology, that is why forecasting is important to help people alleviate the effects of natural disaster, as well as the needed communication technology to do so.</p></td>
